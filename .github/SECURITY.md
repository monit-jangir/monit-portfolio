## Reporting a Vulnerability
We take all security reports seriously. If you discover a vulnerability, please report it **privately** so we can address it before it is publicly disclosed.

🚫 **Do not open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please contact us at:

📧 **Email:** Monit0412s@gmail.com

When reporting, please include:

- **Title:** e.g., `Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Chat Component`  
- **Description:** Explain the potential impact of the vulnerability.  
- **Steps to Reproduce:** A clear, step-by-step guide.  
- **Proof of Concept (PoC):** Code snippets, screenshots, or demo.

## Security Best Practices Implemented
This project is designed with **security-first principles**:

### 🔑 API Key and Secret Management
- No hardcoded secrets in the source code.  
- Environment variables via `.env.local` (excluded from version control).  
- Production secrets managed securely using **Vercel environment variables**.  

### 🔒 API Route Security
- All external API calls (OpenAI, Mistral, GitHub, etc.) handled via **Next.js API routes** (server-only).  
- Input validation and sanitization applied to all user data.  

### 📦 Dependency Management
- **Dependabot** enabled for automated vulnerability scanning.  
- Regular `pnpm audit` checks.  
- Vulnerabilities patched quickly after discovery.  

### 🛡️ Code & Repository Security
- **Branch Protection:** `main` requires pull requests + reviews.  
- **Linting & Static Analysis:** ESLint + best practices to prevent bugs/security issues.  
- **Secret Scanning:** GitHub secret scanning enabled.  

### 🧑‍💻 Infrastructure Security
- HTTPS enforced via hosting provider.  
- CORS configured securely.  
- Rate-limiting applied to API endpoints (planned for production).
